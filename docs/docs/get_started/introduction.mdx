# Introduction

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:
- **Are context-aware**: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
- **Reason**: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)

This framework consists of several parts.
- **LangChain Libraries**: The Python and JavaScript libraries. Contains interfaces and integrations for a myriad of components, a basic run time for combining these components into chains and agents, and off-the-shelf implementations of chains and agents.
- **[LangChain Templates](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/templates)**: A collection of easily deployable reference architectures for a wide variety of tasks.
- **[LangServe](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langserve)**: A library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API.
- **[LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.

Together, these products simplify the entire application lifecycle:
- **Develop**: Write your applications in LangChain/LangChain.js. Hit the ground running using Templates for reference.
- **Productionize**: Use LangSmith to inspect, test and monitor your chains, so that you can constantly improve and deploy with confidence.
- **Deploy**: Turn any chain into an API with LangServe.

## LangChain Libraries

The main value props of the LangChain packages are:
1. **Components**: composable tools and integrations for working with language models. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: built-in assemblages of components for accomplishing higher-level tasks

Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. Components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones.

## Get started

[Here’s](/docs/get_started/installation) how to install LangChain, set up your environment, and start building.

We recommend following our [Quickstart](/docs/get_started/quickstart) guide to familiarize yourself with the framework by building your first LangChain application.

Read up on our [Security](/docs/security) best practices to make sure you're developing safely with LangChain.

:::note

These docs focus on the Python LangChain library. [Head here](https://js.langchain.com) for docs on the JavaScript LangChain library.

## Modules

LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and integrations for the following modules, listed from least to most complex:

#### [Model I/O](/docs/modules/model_io/)
Interface with language models
#### [Retrieval](/docs/modules/data_connection/)
Interface with application-specific data
#### [Chains](/docs/modules/chains/)
Construct sequences of calls
#### [Agents](/docs/modules/agents/)
Let chains choose which tools to use given high-level directives
#### [Memory](/docs/modules/memory/)
Persist application state between runs of a chain
#### [Callbacks](/docs/modules/callbacks/)
Log and stream intermediate steps of any chain
