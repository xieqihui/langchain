# Quickstart

## Installation

To install LangChain run:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="Pip" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">pip install langchain</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="conda" label="Conda">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">conda install langchain -c conda-forge</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/get_started/installation).

## Environment setup

Using LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, APIs, etc. For this example, we'll use OpenAI's model APIs.

First we'll need to install their Python package:

```bash
pip install openai
```

Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Once we have a key we'll want to set it as an environment variable by running:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

If you'd prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the `openai_api_key` named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="...")
```

## LangSmith setup

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.
As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.
The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful.
If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:

```shell
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=...
```

## Building an application

LangChain provides many modules that can be used to build language model applications.
Modules can be used as standalones in simple applications and they can be composed for more complex use cases.
Composition is powered by **LangChain Expression Language** (LCEL), which defines a unified `Runnable` interface that many modules implement, making it possible to seamlessly chain components.

The simplest and most common chain contains three things:
- LLM/Chat Model: The language model is the core reasoning engine here. In order to work with LangChain, you need to understand the different types of language models and how to work with them.
- Prompt Template: This provides instructions to the language model. This controls what the language model outputs, so understanding how to construct prompts and different prompting strategies is crucial.
- Output Parser: These translate the raw response from the language model to a more workable format, making it easy to use the output downstream.

In this guide we'll cover those three components individually, and then go over how to combine them.
Understanding these concepts will set you up well for being able to use and customize LangChain applications.
Most LangChain applications allow you to configure the model and/or the prompt, so knowing how to take advantage of this will be a big enabler.

## LLM / Chat Model

There are two types of language models:

- `LLM`: underlying model takes a string as input and returns a string
- `ChatModel`: underlying model takes a list of messages as input and returns a message

Strings are simple, but what exactly are messages? The base message interface is defined by `BaseMessage`, which has two required attributes:

- `content`: The content of the message. Usually a string.
- `role`: The entity from which the `BaeMessage` is coming.

LangChain provides several objects to easily distinguish between different roles:

- `HumanMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from a human/user.
- `AIMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from an AI/assistant.
- `SystemMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from the system.
- `FunctionMessage` / `ToolMessage`: A `BaseMessage` containing the output of a function or tool call.

If none of those roles sound right, there is also a `ChatMessage` class where you can specify the role manually.

LangChain provides a common interface that's shared by both `LLM`s and `ChatModel`s.
However it's useful to understand the difference in order to most effectively construct prompts for a given language model.

The simplest way to call an `LLM` or `ChatModel` is using `.invoke()`, the universal synchronous call method for all LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) objects:
- `LLM.invoke`: Takes in a string, returns a string.
- `ChatModel.invoke`: Takes in a list of `BaseMessage`, returns a `BaseMessage`.

The input types for these methods are actually more general than this, but for simplicity here we can assume LLMs only take strings and Chat models only takes lists of messages.
Check out the "Go deeper" section below to learn more about model invocation.

Let's see how to work with these different types of models and these different types of inputs.
First, let's import an LLM and a ChatModel.

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

llm = OpenAI()
chat_model = ChatOpenAI()
```

`LLM` and `ChatModel` objects are effectively configuration objects.
You can initialize them with parameters like `temperature` and others, and pass them around.

```python
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage

text = "What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"
messages = [HumanMessage(content=text)]

llm.invoke(text)
# >> Feetful of Fun

chat_model.invoke(messages)
# >> AIMessage(content="Socks O'Color")
```

<details> <summary>Go deeper</summary>

`LLM.invoke` and `ChatModel.invoke` actually both support as input any of `Union[str, List[BaseMessage], PromptValue]`.
`PromptValue` is an object that defines it's own custom logic for returning it's inputs either as a string or as messages.
`LLM`s have logic for coercing any of these into a string, and `ChatModel`s have logic for coercing any of these to messages.
The fact that `LLM` and `ChatModel` accept the same inputs means that you can directly swap them for one another in most chains without breaking anything,
though it's of course important to think about how inputs are being coerced and how that may affect model performance.
To dive deeper on models head to the [Language models](/docs/modules/model_io/models) section.

## Prompt templates

Most LLM applications do not pass user input directly into an LLM. Usually they will add the user input to a larger piece of text, called a prompt template, that provides additional context on the specific task at hand.

In the previous example, the text we passed to the model contained instructions to generate a company name. For our application, it would be great if the user only had to provide the description of a company/product, without having to worry about giving the model instructions.

PromptTemplates help with exactly this!
They bundle up all the logic for going from user input into a fully formatted prompt.
This can start off very simple - for example, a prompt to produce the above string would just be:

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?")
prompt.format(product="colorful socks")
```

```python
What is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks?
```

However, the advantages of using these over raw string formatting are several.
You can "partial" out variables - e.g. you can format only some of the variables at a time.
You can compose them together, easily combining different templates into a single prompt.
For explanations of these functionalities, see the [section on prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts) for more detail.

`PromptTemplate`s can also be used to produce a list of messages.
In this case, the prompt not only contains information about the content, but also each message (its role, its position in the list, etc.).
Here, what happens most often is a `ChatPromptTemplate` is a list of `ChatMessageTemplates`.
Each `ChatMessageTemplate` contains instructions for how to format that `ChatMessage` - its role, and then also its content.
Let's take a look at this below:

```python
from langchain.prompts.chat import ChatPromptTemplate

template = "You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}."
human_template = "{text}"

chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", template),
    ("human", human_template),
])

chat_prompt.format_messages(input_language="English", output_language="French", text="I love programming.")
```

```pycon
[
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.", additional_kwargs={}),
    HumanMessage(content="I love programming.")
]
```


ChatPromptTemplates can also be constructed in other ways - see the [section on prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts) for more detail.

## Output parsers

`OutputParsers` convert the raw output of a language model into a format that can be used downstream.
There are few main types of `OutputParser`s, including:

- Convert text from `LLM` into structured information (e.g. JSON)
- Convert a `ChatMessage` into just a string
- Convert the extra information returned from a call besides the message (like OpenAI function invocation) into a string.

For full information on this, see the [section on output parsers](/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers).

In this getting started guide, we will write our own output parser - one that converts a comma separated list into a list.

```python
from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser

class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser):
    """Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""


    def parse(self, text: str):
        """Parse the output of an LLM call."""
        return text.strip().split(", ")

CommaSeparatedListOutputParser().parse("hi, bye")
# >> ['hi', 'bye']
```

## Prompt template + model + output parser

We can now combine all these into one chain.
This chain will take input variables, pass those to a prompt template to create a prompt, pass the prompt to a language model, and then pass the output through an (optional) output parser.
This is a convenient way to bundle up a modular piece of logic.
Let's see it in action!

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts.chat import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser

class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser):
    """Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""


    def parse(self, text: str):
        """Parse the output of an LLM call."""
        return text.strip().split(", ")

template = """You are a helpful assistant who generates comma separated lists.
A user will pass in a category, and you should generate 5 objects in that category in a comma separated list.
ONLY return a comma separated list, and nothing more."""
human_template = "{text}"

chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", template),
    ("human", human_template),
])
chain = chat_prompt | ChatOpenAI() | CommaSeparatedListOutputParser()
chain.invoke({"text": "colors"})
# >> ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'orange']
```

Note that we are using the `|` syntax to join these components together.
This `|` syntax is powered by the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and relies on the universal `Runnable` interface that all of these objects implement.
To learn more about this syntax, read the documentation [here](/docs/expression_language).

## Seeing this in LangSmith

Assuming we've set our environment variables as shown in the beginning, all of the model and chain calls we've been making will have been automatically logged to LangSmith.
Once there, we can use LangSmith to debug and annotate our application traces, then turn them into datasets for evaluating future iterations of the application.

Check out what the trace for the above chain would look like:
