# Installation

## Official release

To install LangChain run:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="Pip" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">pip install langchain</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="conda" label="Conda">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">conda install langchain -c conda-forge</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will install the bare minimum requirements of LangChain.
A lot of the value of LangChain comes when integrating it with various model providers, datastores, etc.
By default, the dependencies needed to do that are NOT installed. You will need to install the dependencies for specific integrations separately.

## From source

If you want to install from source, you can do so by cloning the repo and be sure that the directory is `PATH/TO/REPO/langchain/libs/langchain` running:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Langchain experimental
The `langchain-experimental` package holds experimental LangChain code, intended for research and experimental uses.

LangServe is automatically installed by LangChain CLI.
