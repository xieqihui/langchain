    "One of the most common types of databases that we can build Q&A systems for are SQL databases. LangChain comes with a number of built-in chains and agents that are compatible with any SQL dialect supported by SQLAlchemy (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Databricks, SQLite). They enable use cases such as:\n",

    "## ⚠️ Security note ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "Building Q&A systems of SQL databases requires executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent's needs. This will mitigate though not eliminate the risks of building a model-driven system. For more on general security best practices, [see here](/docs/security).\n",
