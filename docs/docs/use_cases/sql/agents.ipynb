    "LangChain has a SQL Agent which provides a more flexible way of interacting with SQL Databases than a chain. The main advantages of using the SQL Agent are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can answer questions based on the databases' schema as well as on the databases' content (like describing a specific table).\n",
    "- It can recover from errors by running a generated query, catching the traceback and regenerating it correctly.\n",
    "- It can query the database as many times as needed to answer the user question.\n",
    "- It will save tokens by only retrieving the schema from relevant tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize the agent we'll use the [create_sql_agent](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/agent_toolkits/langchain_community.agent_toolkits.sql.base.create_sql_agent.html) constructor. This agent uses the `SQLDatabaseToolkit` which contains tools to: \n",
