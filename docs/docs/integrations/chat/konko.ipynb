    "1. **Explore Available Models:** Start by browsing through the [available models](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/list-of-models) on Konko. Each model caters to different use cases and capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify Suitable Endpoints:** Determine which [endpoint](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/list-of-models#list-of-available-models) (ChatCompletion or Completion) supports your selected model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Selecting a Model:** [Choose a model](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/list-of-models#list-of-available-models) based on its metadata and how well it fits your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prompting Guidelines:** Once a model is selected, refer to the [prompting guidelines](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/prompting) to effectively communicate with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Using the API:** Finally, use the appropriate Konko [API endpoint](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/quickstart-for-completion-and-chat-completion-endpoint) to call the model and receive responses.\n",

In short, it suggests that the universe began as an infinitely hot and dense point around 13.8 billion years ago and expanded rapidly. This expansion continues to this day, and it's what makes the universe look the way it does.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of the key points:\\n\\n1. The universe started as a singularity, a point of infinite density and temperature.\\n2. The singularity expanded rapidly, causing the universe to cool and expand.\\n3. As the universe expanded, particles began to form, including protons, neutrons, and electrons.\\n4. These particles eventually came together to form atoms, and later, stars and galaxies.\\n5. The universe is still expanding today, and the rate of this expansion is accelerating.\\n\\nThat's the Big Bang Theory in a nutshell! It's a pretty mind-blowing idea when you think about it, and it's supported by a lot of scientific evidence. Do you have any other questions about it?\")"
