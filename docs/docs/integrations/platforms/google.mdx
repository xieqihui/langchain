> (Scalable Nearest Neighbors) is a python package.
> 
>`ScaNN` is a method for efficient vector similarity search at scale.

>`ScaNN` includes search space pruning and quantization for Maximum Inner
> Product Search and also supports other distance functions such as
> Euclidean distance. The implementation is optimized for x86 processors
> with AVX2 support. See its [Google Research github](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann)
> for more details.

We need to install `scann` python package.

```bash
pip install scann
```

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/scann).

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import ScaNN
```

## Retrievers
### Vertex AI Search

> [Google Cloud Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/introduction)
> allows developers to quickly build generative AI powered search engines for customers and employees.

First, you need to install the `google-cloud-discoveryengine` Python package.

```bash
pip install google-cloud-discoveryengine
```

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/retrievers/google_vertex_ai_search).

```python
from langchain.retrievers import GoogleVertexAISearchRetriever
```

### Document AI Warehouse
> [Google Cloud Document AI Warehouse](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai-warehouse)
> allows enterprises to search, store, govern, and manage documents and their AI-extracted 
> data and metadata in a single platform. Documents should be uploaded outside of Langchain,
> 

```python
from langchain.retrievers import GoogleDocumentAIWarehouseRetriever
docai_wh_retriever = GoogleDocumentAIWarehouseRetriever(
    project_number=...
)
query = ...
documents = docai_wh_retriever.get_relevant_documents(
    query, user_ldap=...
)
```

## Tools
### Google Search

- Install requirements with `pip install google-api-python-client`
- Set up a Custom Search Engine, following [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37083058/programmatically-searching-google-in-python-using-custom-search)
- Get an API Key and Custom Search Engine ID from the previous step, and set them as environment variables `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` respectively

There exists a `GoogleSearchAPIWrapper` utility which wraps this API. To import this utility:

```python
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of this wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/tools/google_search).

We can easily load this wrapper as a Tool (to use with an Agent). We can do this with:

```python
from langchain.agents import load_tools
tools = load_tools(["google-search"])
```

### Google Places

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/tools/google_places).

```
pip install googlemaps
```

```python
from langchain.tools import GooglePlacesTool
```

## Document Transformers

### Google Document AI

>[Document AI](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/overview) is a `Google Cloud Platform` 
> service to transform unstructured data from documents into structured data, making it easier 
> to understand, analyze, and consume.  

We need to set up a [`GCS` bucket and create your own OCR processor](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/create-processor)  
The `GCS_OUTPUT_PATH` should be a path to a folder on GCS (starting with `gs://`) 
and a processor name should look like `projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION/processors/PROCESSOR_ID`.
We can get it either programmatically or copy from the `Prediction endpoint` section of the `Processor details`
tab in the Google Cloud Console.

```bash
pip install google-cloud-documentai
pip install google-cloud-documentai-toolbox
```

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/docai).

```python
from langchain.document_loaders.blob_loaders import Blob
from langchain.document_loaders.parsers import DocAIParser
```

### Google Translate

> [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) is a multilingual neural machine
> translation service developed by Google to translate text, documents and websites
> from one language into another.

The `GoogleTranslateTransformer` allows you to translate text and HTML with the [Google Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate).

To use it, you should have the `google-cloud-translate` python package installed, and a Google Cloud project with the [Translation API enabled](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/setup). This transformer uses the [Advanced edition (v3)](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/intro-to-v3).

First, we need to install the python package.

```bash
pip install google-cloud-translate
```

See a [usage example and authorization instructions](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/google_translate).

```python
from langchain.document_transformers import GoogleTranslateTransformer
```
