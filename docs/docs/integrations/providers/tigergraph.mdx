What is TigerGraph?

**TigerGraph in a nutshell:**

- TigerGraph is a natively distributed and high-performance graph database.
- The storage of data in a graph format of vertices and edges leads to rich relationships, ideal for grouding LLM responses.
- Get started quickly with TigerGraph by visiting [their website](https://tigergraph.com/).

## Installation and Setup

- Install the Python SDK with `pip install pyTigerGraph`

## Wrappers

### TigerGraph Store
To utilize the TigerGraph InquiryAI functionality, you can import `TigerGraph` from `langchain_community.graphs`.

```python
import pyTigerGraph as tg
conn = tg.TigerGraphConnection(host="DATABASE_HOST_HERE", graphname="GRAPH_NAME_HERE", username="USERNAME_HERE", password="PASSWORD_HERE")

### ==== CONFIGURE INQUIRYAI HOST ====
conn.ai.configureInquiryAIHost("INQUIRYAI_HOST_HERE")

from langchain_community.graphs import TigerGraph
graph = TigerGraph(conn)
result = graph.query("How many servers are there?")
print(result)
```
