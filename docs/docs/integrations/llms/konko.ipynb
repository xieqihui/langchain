    "### Steps to Access Models\n",
    "1. **Explore Available Models:** Start by browsing through the [available models](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/list-of-models) on Konko. Each model caters to different use cases and capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify Suitable Endpoints:** Determine which [endpoint](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/list-of-models#list-of-available-models) (ChatCompletion or Completion) supports your selected model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Selecting a Model:** [Choose a model](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/list-of-models#list-of-available-models) based on its metadata and how well it fits your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prompting Guidelines:** Once a model is selected, refer to the [prompting guidelines](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/prompting) to effectively communicate with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Using the API:** Finally, use the appropriate Konko [API endpoint](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/quickstart-for-completion-and-chat-completion-endpoint) to call the model and receive responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with `Konko` completion [models](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/list-of-models#konko-hosted-models-for-completion)\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, you'll need Konko API key. You can create one by signing up on [Konko](https://www.konko.ai/)."
