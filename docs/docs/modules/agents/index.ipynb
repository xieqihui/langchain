    "The core idea of agents is to use a language model to choose a sequence of actions to take.\n",
    "In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code).\n",
    "In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "There are several key components here:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the chain responsible for deciding what step to take next.\n",
    "This is powered by a language model and a prompt.\n",
    "The inputs to this chain are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tools: Descriptions of available tools\n",
    "2. User input: The high level objective\n",
    "3. Intermediate steps: Any (action, tool output) pairs previously executed in order to achieve the user input\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is the next action(s) to take or the final response to send to the user (`AgentAction`s or `AgentFinish`). An action specifies a tool and the input to that tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different agents have different prompting styles for reasoning, different ways of encoding inputs, and different ways of parsing the output.\n",
    "For a full list of built-in agents see [agent types](/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/).\n",
    "You can also **easily build custom agents**, which we show how to do in the Get started section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools are functions that an agent can invoke.\n",
    "There are two important design considerations around tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Giving the agent access to the right tools\n",
    "2. Describing the tools in a way that is most helpful to the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Without thinking through both, you won't be able to build a working agent.\n",
    "If you don't give the agent access to a correct set of tools, it will never be able to accomplish the objectives you give it.\n",
    "If you don't describe the tools well, the agent won't know how to use them properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides a wide set of built-in tools, but also makes it easy to define your own (including custom descriptions).\n",
    "For a full list of built-in tools, see the [tools integrations section](/docs/integrations/tools/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Toolkits\n",
    "\n",
    "For many common tasks, an agent will need a set of related tools.\n",
    "For this LangChain provides the concept of toolkits - groups of around 3-5 tools needed to accomplish specific objectives.\n",
    "For example, the GitHub toolkit has a tool for searching through GitHub issues, a tool for reading a file, a tool for commenting, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides a wide set of toolkits to get started.\n",
    "For a full list of built-in toolkits, see the [toolkits integrations section](/docs/integrations/toolkits/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### AgentExecutor\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent executor is the runtime for an agent.\n",
    "This is what actually calls the agent, executes the actions it chooses, passes the action outputs back to the agent, and repeats.\n",
    "In pseudocode, this looks roughly like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "next_action = agent.get_action(...)\n",
    "while next_action != AgentFinish:\n",
    "    observation = run(next_action)\n",
    "    next_action = agent.get_action(..., next_action, observation)\n",
    "return next_action\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While this may seem simple, there are several complexities this runtime handles for you, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Handling cases where the agent selects a non-existent tool\n",
    "2. Handling cases where the tool errors\n",
    "3. Handling cases where the agent produces output that cannot be parsed into a tool invocation\n",
    "4. Logging and observability at all levels (agent decisions, tool calls) to stdout and/or to [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other types of agent runtimes\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AgentExecutor` class is the main agent runtime supported by LangChain.\n",
    "However, there are other, more experimental runtimes we also support.\n",
    "These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Plan-and-execute Agent](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/plan_and_execute)\n",
    "- [Baby AGI](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/baby_agi)\n",
    "- [Auto GPT](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/autogpt)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also always create your own custom execution logic, which we show how to do below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get started\n",
    "\n",
    "To best understand the agent framework, lets build an agent from scratch using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL).\n",
    "We'll need to build the agent itself, define custom tools, and run the agent and tools in a custom loop. At the end we'll show how to use the standard LangChain `AgentExecutor` to make execution easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important terminology (and schema) to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `AgentAction`: This is a dataclass that represents the action an agent should take. It has a `tool` property (which is the name of the tool that should be invoked) and a `tool_input` property (the input to that tool)\n",
    "2. `AgentFinish`: This is a dataclass that signifies that the agent has finished and should return to the user. It has a `return_values` parameter, which is a dictionary to return. It often only has one key - `output` - that is a string, and so often it is just this key that is returned.\n",
    "3. `intermediate_steps`: These represent previous agent actions and corresponding outputs that are passed around. These are important to pass to future iteration so the agent knows what work it has already done. This is typed as a `List[Tuple[AgentAction, Any]]`. Note that observation is currently left as type `Any` to be maximally flexible. In practice, this is often a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup: LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, agents take a self-determined, input-dependent sequence of steps before returning a user-facing output. This makes debugging these systems particularly tricky, and observability particularly important. [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith) is especially useful for such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building with LangChain, any built-in agent or custom agent built with LCEL will automatically be traced in LangSmith. And if we use the `AgentExecutor`, we'll get full tracing of not only the agent planning steps but also the tool inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up LangSmith we just need set the following environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"\n",
    "export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"<your-api-key>\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "We first need to create our agent.\n",
    "This is the chain responsible for determining what action to take next.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use OpenAI Function Calling to create this agent.\n",
    "**This is generally the most reliable way to create agents.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this guide, we will construct a custom agent that has access to a custom tool.\n",
    "We are choosing this example because for most real world use cases you will NEED to customize either the agent or the tools. \n",
    "We'll create a simple tool that computes the length of a word.\n",
    "This is useful because it's actually something LLMs can mess up due to tokenization.\n",
    "We will first create it WITHOUT memory, but we will then show how to add memory in.\n",
    "Memory is needed to enable conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's load the language model we're going to use to control the agent."
