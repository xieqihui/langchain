Hint:  `https://example.quip.com/<folder_id>`\n* How to know thread_id ? \n  thread_id is the document id. Go to quip doc, right click doc and copy link, extract suffix from link as thread_id. Hint: `https://exmaple.quip.com/<thread_id>`\n  \nYou can also set `include_all_folders` as `True` will fetch group_folder_ids and \nYou can also specify a boolean `include_attachments` to include attachments, this is set to False by default, if set to True all attachments will be downloaded and QuipLoader will extract the text from the attachments and add it to the Document object. Currently supported attachment types are: `PDF`, `PNG`, `JPEG/JPG`, `SVG`, `Word` and `Excel`. Also you can sepcify a boolean `include_comments` to include comments in document, this is set to False by default, if set to True all comments in document will be fetched and QuipLoader will add them to Document objec.\n",
